  <h4>
    Make your own sweet chilli sauce to cook with. This Thai condiment often contains fish sauce but weâ€™ve kept our version veggie
  </h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Red chilli - 3 stk</li>
    <li>Salt - 1 tsp</li>
    <li>Cloves of garlic - 2</li>
    <li>Oil - 1 tbs</li>
    <li>Pinapple - 3 dl</li>
    <li>Vinegar - 1/2 dl</li>
    <li>Sugar - 3 dl</li>
    <li>Dried chilli flakes - 4 tbs</li>
    <li>Cornstarch - 2 tsb</li>
    <li>Cold water - 4 tsb</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Finely chop the chilli and mash in a mortar with salt and garlic to a coarse mass. Fry quickly in a pan with oil while stirring, approx. 30 seconds.</li>
    <li>Add pineapple juice, vinegar and sugar and bring to a boil. Stir in chili flakes and simmer for approx. 10 minutes. Make sure it doesn't boil for too long, then you'll get a crack rather than a sauce.</li>
    <li>Stir Maizena into cold water and season the sauce with the mixture, stirring constantly. Continue cooking until the sauce is thick.</li>
    <li>

Pour the sauce into tight glasses and cool. The sauce can be kept in the fridge for several months.
