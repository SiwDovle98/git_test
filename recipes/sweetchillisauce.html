      Finely chop the chilli and mash in a mortar with salt and garlic to a
      coarse mass. Fry quickly in a pan with oil while stirring, approx. 30
      seconds.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add pineapple juice, vinegar and sugar and bring to a boil. Stir in chili
      flakes and simmer for approx. 10 minutes. Make sure it doesn't boil for
      too long, then you'll get a crack rather than a sauce.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir Maizena into cold water and season the sauce with the mixture,
      stirring constantly. Continue cooking until the sauce is thick.
    </li>

      Pour the sauce into tight glasses and cool. The sauce can be kept in the
      fridge for several months.
